Experimental Design/Sampling Description:
Daily data from the Arctic LTER Toolik Field Station weather station. Where possible two nearby stations were used to fill in missing data using regressions to estimate the missing values. The Arctic LTER tussock station is 700 meters away and has the best regression fit. The Imnavait weather station is 12 kilometers away and 200 meters higher. There are good summer air temp regressions with Toolik but during the winter months the variability is greater (Larry Hinzman and Doug Kane Water Research Center; University of Alaska Fairbanks; Fairbanks, AK 99775-5860). From 1989 to 1998 summer only precipitation was collected at Toolik. Winter precipitation data from the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Alaska Imnavait weather station was used to fill in the winter data. This precipitation gage has a Wyoming windshield installed. In fall of 1998 year round precipitation at Toolik was started.

Weather data has been collected at Toolik Lake by the Arctic LTER since June 1988. Sensors that are measured every minute and averaged or totaled every hour include: air temperature and relative humidity at 1 and 5 meters, wind speed at 1 and 5 meters, wind direction at 5 meters, global solar radiation, photosynthetically active radiation, barometric pressure, and unfrozen precipitation. Sensors measured every 10 minutes and averaged every three hours include: soil temperatures, lake temperature, lake depth, and evaporation pan depth and pan water temperature. In the fall of 1998 a Campbell CS705 Snowfall adapter was added for snowfall measurements. In 1999 a Wyoming windshield was added 30Aug99. In August 2006 a OTT Pluvio Precipitation Gauge. (Standard with a heating ring. Resolution: 0.01/0.1; Collecting area 200 cm2; Total quantity 250 mm) replaced the tipping rain gauge/CS705 adapter.

See http://ecosystems.mbl.edu/ARC/weather/sensors.html for a description of the sensors used.

Notes and Comments:
Wind Speeds less than .447 are considered calm. For the global solar radiation and photosynthetically active radiation sensors no attempt is made to correct for frost or snow on the sensors during the winter months. Therefore winter radiation data should be view as suspect and used only qualitatively.
