         When you use AmeriFlux data:

         - Inform the AmeriFlux scientist(s) who contributed the data how you plan to use the data and of any publication plans.

         - Initiate contact with the data contributor, so that they have the opportunity to contribute substantively and as a result to be a co-author.

         - Acknowledge AmeriFlux data by citing the relevant DOI or paper(s), and/or acknowledging funding for the site support. 
           Refer to the Site_General_Info BADM file for the preferred acknowledgment language or ask the site principal investigator.

1) OVERVIEW OF THE DATA FILE CONTENTS

This version of the AmeriFlux data files are made available at the AmeriFlux web site (http://ameriflux.lbl.gov). The BASE files follow the new AmeriFlux data format developed in partnership with the European Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS). The BASE files are generated directly from the AmeriFlux data files known as Level 2 (ftp://cdiac.ornl.gov/pub/ameriflux/data/Level2/L2_Readme.doc) created by the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC). The BASE files contain non-gapfilled data, mostly as provided by the tower teams and site PIs, and converted into the new AmeriFlux data sharing format. This is the data subset most commonly sent to AmeriFlux and most commonly used. If you prefer the older AmeriFlux format files they are available at http://ameriflux.ornl.gov/. For more information on the new format, please visit the Data section of the AmeriFlux web site at http://ameriflux.lbl.gov/data/



2) DATA FILE NAME

The BASE data file names have the following format:

    [publisher]_[siteID]_BASE_[resolution]_[version].csv

For instance:

    AMF_US-Ha1_BASE_HR_8-1.csv

This example file name is published by the AmeriFlux network (AMF); it has data collected at the "Harvard Forest EMS Tower (HFR1)" site (US-Ha1); it uses an hourly resolution (HR); and, its version is 8-1. For details on site IDs and versions, please see DATA FILE HEADERS below.

Note that there are only two possible temporal resolutions for BASE files: HR for hourly and HH for half-hourly. Sites can use one or both resolutions.



3) DATA FILE HEADER

The header of the data file is composed of lines starting with a hash character (#). The fields in the headers each have a label, a colon character (:), and the value of the field.

In the current version of this data product, the header is composed of two fields: Site and Version.

Site contains the site identification (ID) code in the following format (CC-SSS): two characters identifying country, a dash character (-), and three characters identifying the site. For instance, US-Ha1 is the site ID for the "Harvard Forest EMS Tower (HFR1)" site located in the United States.

The Version contains two components (Major-Minor):
    - Major version - corresponds to the version number assigned by CDIAC to the files. Changes in the major version indicate changes in the data.  
    - Minor version - corresponds to the version of the file generation in the new format. Changes in the minor version indicate minor formatting and conversion changes. In most cases, the minor version component will be 1.

Sample BASE data file header:

   # Site: US-Ha1
   # Version: 8-1



4) DATA FILE CONTENTS

The BASE data files follow the new AmeriFlux and ICOS agreed standard for variable names. The current version of the BASE data product is a direct translation of the data files generated by CDIAC. One change in the new data format is the naming of variable heights/layers: Layers are numbered top (1 designates the highest point) to bottom (lowest point). The layer is indicated as a single numeric suffix on variable labels. Variables measured at more than one layer must be have their labels suffixed with the corresponding layer. For variables measured at a single layer, the suffix can be omitted. For instance, layer 1 for CO2 is the top layer (previously known as labeled CO2TOP), while layer 2 is the one used for calculation of fluxes. Furthermore, for both TS and SWC, layer 1 is shallower and layer 2 is deeper (Note that, TS_1 can be at a different depth than SWC_1). Timestamps are specified in truncated ISO format with both the start and end timestamps of the averaging period.

The number and order of columns in these files is not guaranteed to be uniform -- they might be uniform when generated at the same time, but this is not a guarantee. A few variables, like RECO and GPP, can be derived both independently by tower teams and uniformly at the network level. Variable labels suffixed with "_PI" are versions derived by the tower team.

These data files are provided as plain ASCII text using comma-separated values (CSV) formating. Missing data records are indicated by the -9999 value. The first row after the headers provides the variable labels. Variables, units (in parenthesis), descriptions, and previous CDIAC variable labels (in square brackets) are listed below.
