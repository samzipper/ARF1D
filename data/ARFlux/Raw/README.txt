ARFlux_2008-2012_(Severity).csv files are eddy flux tower data for unburned, moderate, and severity fire locations with half-hour resolution. See description here: http://arc-lter.ecosystems.mbl.edu/2012arfluxunburned . Years were downloaded individually and copied-pasted together.

ZipperSoilTempData08-16.xlsx spreadsheet received from Adrian Rocha via email on 8/17/2017 with the following note:
"Here it is and sorry for the delay.  I have noticed some weird trends with the Severely burned site with only slightly 
 higher soil temperatures than the Unburned site in recent years, but with deeper soil depths.  I wanted to see if this
 was a sensor issue and it appears that it isn't.  Not sure what is going on here, but noticed that the daily amplitude
 of soil temperature is highest at the Severely burned site.  Perhaps it is this variability that is more important in
 regulating thaw than the daily average soil T.  It could also be that the sites where these sensors have been installed
 have been shaded by the vigorous vegetation regrowth at this site."
